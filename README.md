---

> [!WARNING]
> This is the v3 branch for ClassPro
> 
> This branch is an architectural change moving from CSR to PPR (Partial Prerendering) and SSR (Server side rendering) techniques to make it faster, vigiliant and reliable.
>
> We had to
> - Rewrite entire frontend codebase
> - Rewrite backend to Golang with fiber
> - Change architectures and logics
> - Change how we display data
> - Using alot of portals to display
>
> This results in
> - `Best Performance`: We don't cache your data anymore, Everything's loaded and updated parallel with `goroutines`
> - `Server sided madness`: Nearly everything is rendered on server sided and caches the components, resulting in faster loading speeds
> - `Reduced junk`: We reduced nearly 60% of Nodes, so less components -> less bundle size -> faster speeds
> - `Custom Themes`: Rebuilt entire theme engine from scratch to support custom themes. Open a PR to add themes ðŸ˜ƒ
> - `Search algorithms`: We added fuzzy search to our links and added Faculties search
> - `Much accurate faculty results`: We had to scrape the names of staffs, now results in nearly ~93% accuracy in url results in course page
> - `Customizable timetable`: Added a way to toggle optional hours in timetable.
> - `Cleaner Calendar and Timetable`: It was filled with alot of Element Nodes, now its the same UI with 60% fewer Elements.
> - `Reimagined Attendance Predict`: Redrew everything from scratch to have an efficient, quicker and accurate prediction algorithm.
> - `Smart detection`: It identifies if session is invalid, ratelimits users and more
